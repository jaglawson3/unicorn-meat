# unicorn-meat

This is a first attempt...

Unicorns should actually eat meat. Then they would be far cooler mythological creatures. Then again, maybe that is just stupid. Yeah that is pretty stupid. Largely because no member of the equine family has ever been known to eat meat and it is generally agreed upon that unicorns represent unknown taxa within the equine family.
